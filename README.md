# Docker-Orchestrated SOAR Environment on Oracle Cloud


Architected Integration of Wazuh (SIEM/XDR), Suricata (IDS/IPS), Shuffle (SOAR platform), MISP (threat intelligence), and TheHive (incident response) and utilized Docker and custom Docker networks for the containerized components in Oracle Cloud environment.

Automated end-to-end incident response workflow, featuring automatic detection of SQL injection attempts on an Apache2 web server, threat correlation with MISP, case creation in TheHive, and HTML-formatted email alerts.
